Implemented a movie recommendation system using PySpark that
employs Jaccard, Cosine, and Centered Cosine similarity metrics to
suggest movies based on user preferences. The system allows users
to input their ID within a given range and generates
recommendations by analyzing similarity with other users' ratings,
enhancing personalized movie suggestions.
